3. User Account, Minimum Age, Consumer Protection
3.1 Certain features require an account. Registration requires truthful information (at least first name and e-mail) and acceptance of these T&Cs and the Privacy Notice. 3.2 Minimum age / minors’ consent: The App is primarily aimed at persons 14 years and older. If a user is under 14 or otherwise lacks capacity under local law, consent of a legal guardian is required. The provider may implement age/consent checks. 3.3 Consumer protection: If the user is a consumer under Austrian law (KSchG), the mandatory provisions of Austrian consumer law (in particular KSchG, FAGG) apply in addition.
4. Licence & Permitted Use
4.1 The provider grants a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to use the App on supported devices. 4.2 Prohibited, inter alia: (i) reverse engineering, (ii) circumvention of technical protection measures, (iii) unlawful use, (iv) automated scraping, (v) uploading unlawful, infringing, discriminatory or harmful content.
5. Content, AI Features & Disclaimers
5.1 Content (texts, colours, recommendations) may be generated in whole or in part using AI systems. AI outputs are probabilistic and may be inaccurate; they do not replace professional advice. Colour/skin/product fit metrics are approximate. 5.2 Users are responsible for their uploads and represent that they hold the necessary rights; they shall indemnify the provider against third-party claims arising from culpable infringements.
6. In-App Purchases, Subscriptions & Prices
6.1 Subscriptions (e.g., weekly/yearly) renew automatically until cancelled in the respective store (Apple App Store/Google Play). Trial periods, prices in EUR (incl. VAT where applicable) and included features are shown before purchase. 6.2 Processing & withdrawals/refunds: Digital purchases are processed by the respective store; withdrawals/refunds follow store rules and mandatory consumer rights. If digital content is provided immediately, the right of withdrawal may lapse if the user expressly consents and acknowledges the loss (see Withdrawal Policy). 6.3 Price changes: Effective immediately for new purchases; for ongoing subscriptions after prior notice per store rules with right to object/cancel. 6.4 Trials & renewal: Free/discounted trials convert to paid subscriptions unless cancelled in time. For technical reasons, cancellation may be required up to 24 hours before the end of the term to avoid renewal. 6.5 Payment & invoices: Payment (incl. invoicing, refunds, FX) is handled exclusively by the store. Prices are shown in EUR (incl.

An account may be required to use on multiple devices. 6.9 No new right of withdrawal on renewals/test-to-paid: Statutory withdrawal exists once at contract start. Neither auto-renewal nor conversion from free trial to paid creates a new withdrawal right.

7.1 The App contains affiliate links and/or advertising. If you purchase via such links, we may receive a commission. Disclosure: Such content is clearly labelled (“Ad/Advertisement/Affiliate link”); for Amazon we additionally display: “As an Amazon Associate we earn from qualifying purchases.” 7.2 No contract with us for third-party goods/services; the merchant’s terms/privacy apply. Product images, prices, availability and ratings are non-binding and may change. 7.3 Ad labelling & paid placements: Ads are clearly marked. For paid placements (e.g., highlighted product cards) we disclose key ranking criteria (relevance, seasonal fit, cooperation) in-app. 7.4 Personalised ads & ad IDs: If we use personalised ads, we rely on device signals (e.g., IDFA/AAID) and consent via our CMP. Personalised ads are opt-in and can be withdrawn in Privacy Settings. Without consent, we show contextual ads only. 7.5 Youth protection & sensitive categories: The App is not directed at children. We do not show personalised ads to users without valid consent and avoid sensitive categories where controllable via our ad partners. 7.6 Ad-tech partners: We may use third-party SDKs (e.g., Google AdMob). See our Privacy Notice for vendors, data categories, legal bases and retention.

It also explains consents, withdrawal options and data subject rights (GDPR/DSG; and, where applicable, CCPA/CPRA/CalOPPA for US users). 8.2 For processing that requires consent (e.g., personalised ads, full-scope analytics, affiliate attribution, access to camera/photos), we use a Consent Management Platform (CMP). Some features may depend on consent; consents are voluntary and can be withdrawn at any time in Settings > Privacy. 8.3 Google Analytics (GA4): We use GA4 to measure reach and improve the App. We process event data, pseudonymous identifiers and device information; IP addresses are processed only in anonymised form. You can opt out anytime in the App’s Privacy section. Details (retention, international transfers, SCCs) in the Privacy Notice. 8.4 Consent controls (CMP): Manage consents in Settings > Privacy; certain features (e.g., personalised ads) may be limited without consent. 8.5 Data transfers: Where providers outside the EEA are used, we implement appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses). Details in the Privacy Notice.
9. Warranty & Liability
9.1 Statutory warranty applies.

13.1 The EU ODR platform: https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr 13.2 We are neither obliged nor willing to participate in alternative dispute resolution before a consumer ADR entity. Statutory consumer rights remain unaffected.
14. Final Provisions
14.1 Austrian law applies, excluding conflict-of-law rules and the UN Sales Convention. For consumers, this choice applies only insofar as mandatory protections of their habitual residence remain intact. 14.2 Place of jurisdiction is the provider’s seat where permissible. Statutory consumer fora apply. 14.3 If any provision is invalid or unenforceable, the remainder remains effective; statutory provisions shall apply instead.

15. Technical Requirements & Compatibility
A compatible device, current OS version and internet connection are required. Features and performance may vary by device/OS/region/connection. Certain features (e.g., social login, payments, deep links) require third-party services whose availability is outside our control.
